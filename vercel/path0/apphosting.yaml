# This file contains the configuration for Firebase App Hosting.
# It defines the runtime behavior of the backend, including instance scaling, CPU, and memory allocation.
# These settings are optimized for cost-effectiveness by allowing scale-to-zero while managing performance under load.

runConfig:
  minInstances: 0         # allows scale-to-zero (no idle cost)
  maxInstances: 5         # limit overhead
  concurrency: 80         # high, to reduce instances under load
  cpu: 1                  # cut vCPU usage
  memoryMiB: 256          # minimal viable memory
